# In which cases we will use all

                                        # wehn we use more than one condition in if cases

# What is the differences between any , or

# If we need all the conditions to be true we will use ....

# What is the differences between if , elif

# What is the differences between elif else

# Can we use more than one elif

# Can we use more than one else

# write s simple ternary operator

# in elif , python will check all the conditions no matter what ?

# in elif we use else for ... ?

# if we have this list [2,4,6,8,10] :
listName=[2,4,6,8,10]:

# check to see if 4 in this list or not

# check to see if 4 and 6 in this list on not

# check to see if 3 or 6 in this list

# check to see if 2 , 4 and 5 in this list
